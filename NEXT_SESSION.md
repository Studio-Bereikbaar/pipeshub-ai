# Next Session Tasks - Awaiting Abhishek Response

**Date**: August 22, 2025  
**Status**: Waiting for developer guidance  

## Current Situation

### ✅ COMPLETED
1. **SMTP Issue**: Solved with pipeshub@studiobereikbaar.nl service account
2. **User Synchronization Bug**: Fixed and deployed (commit c36a443)
   - Users now properly sync from MongoDB to ArangoDB when invited
   - info@studiobereikbaar.nl can login successfully
3. **Message Drafted**: Ready to send to Abhishek with technical details

### ❓ AWAITING ABHISHEK RESPONSE

**Message Sent**: [TO BE UPDATED WHEN SENT]

**Key Question**: How should users share knowledge bases with team members?

**Technical Context Provided**:
- SMTP solution using Microsoft 365 service account
- User sync bug discovered and fixed
- Current issue: Users can login but can't see uploaded knowledge bases
- Adding users to MongoDB groups (like "DB-Team") doesn't grant KB access
- KB permissions currently check direct user→KB edges in ArangoDB only

## Expected Response Topics

Abhishek may provide guidance on:

1. **Knowledge Base Sharing UI**: 
   - Is there an existing UI feature for sharing KBs?
   - How are KB permissions supposed to work?

2. **Group-Based Permissions**:
   - Should groups automatically grant KB access?
   - Is this a missing feature or configuration issue?

3. **Architecture Clarification**:
   - How is KB sharing intended to work in the current design?
   - Any upcoming features for team collaboration?

## Next Actions (After Response)

Depending on Abhishek's response:

### If UI Feature Exists:
- [ ] Locate and test the KB sharing feature
- [ ] Update documentation with sharing workflow
- [ ] Test with info@studiobereikbaar.nl

### If Missing Feature:
- [ ] Implement group-based KB permissions
- [ ] Modify ArangoDB queries to include group membership
- [ ] Create PR to upstream if beneficial

### If Configuration Issue:
- [ ] Fix configuration/setup
- [ ] Document correct setup process
- [ ] Test and verify functionality

## Technical Notes for Implementation

If we need to implement group-based KB permissions:

**Current Query** (direct permissions only):
```aql
FOR perm IN @@permissions_collection
    FILTER perm._from == @user_from
```

**Needed Enhancement** (include group permissions):
```aql
// Check direct user permissions
FOR perm IN @@permissions_collection
    FILTER perm._from == @user_from
UNION
// Check group-based permissions
FOR userGroup IN userGroups
    FILTER @user_id IN userGroup.users
    FOR groupPerm IN @@permissions_collection
        FILTER groupPerm._from == userGroup._id
```

## Files to Monitor

- `/backend/nodejs/apps/src/modules/user_management/controller/users.controller.ts` (our fix)
- `/backend/python/app/connectors/sources/localKB/core/arango_service.py` (KB permissions)
- ArangoDB collections: `users`, `userGroups`, `permissionsToKB`
